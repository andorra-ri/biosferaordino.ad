  what_is: What is a Biosphere Reserve?

The main aim is to establish a scientific basis for enhancing the relationship between people and their environments, working to fulfil the Sustainable Development Goals.

  in_ordino: Ordino Biosphere Reserve is an example of mountain landscapes and communities that is remarkable for its sustainable way of life and the positive transformation that is already underway. We have chosen this path to show that it is possible to live in harmony with nature while enjoying social wellbeing.
  history: History
  our_history: The Comú (town council) of Ordino started the application in 2019 for recognition of the parish as a Biosphere Reserve, the first on a national scale and the second in the Pyrenean mountains. The process, which included an informative and participative stage involving all sectors and stakeholders inside the area, continued until October 2020, when the MAB International Co-ordinating Council officially designated the Parish of Ordino a Biosphere Reserve in its 32nd session, and it became part of the European Biosphere Reserve network under the central theme of mountains.

    conservation:
      name: Conservation
      task: Contributing to the conservation of landscapes, ecosystems and biodiversity.
    development:
      name: Development
      task: Promoting economic and human development that is environmentally, socially and culturally sustainable.
    logistics:
      name: Logistic support
      task: Encouraging projects and actions for environmental awareness and education, promoting research and monitoring local conservation and sustainability initiatives.

  zones:
    global:
      name: Biosphere Reserve Zoning
      desc: To perform its functions, the area needs to be divided into specific zones.
    core:
      name: Core area
      desc: This follows the boundaries of Sorteny Natural Park, an area of 1080 hectares (10.8 km2). The Sorteny Valley is one of the finest examples of Pyrenean mountain ecosystems, both biologically and culturally. In general, the park permits sustainable tourism, traditional extensive livestock farming, environmental education and scientific research activities.
    buffer:
      name: Buffer zone
      desc: This covers 6134 ha, representing 72% of the total reserve area. It mainly consists of the publicly-owned woodlands, pastures and mountains of Ordino. Activities with a low environmental impact are permitted, such as livestock farming, sustainable forest management, hunting and fishing, mountain leisure and sports activities, etc. Equally, the regulations for certain practices and activities within the buffer zone must be observed, such as access by motor vehicle or camping.
    transition:
      name: Transition area
      desc: This comprises all the urban and rural areas, which are mostly located at the bottom of the valleys and represent 14.8% of the whole reserve. The focus of this area is to encourage social and economic development from a sustainable perspective. This area is destined for any kind of activity permitted by current legislation, such as building development under the parish of Ordino’s planning regulations.

  logo: The Biosphere Reserve logo
  logo_shape: 'The logo depicts the two key elements: nature, represented by the central flower, based on Sorteny, and human activities, through the leaves that symbolise people with open arms.'
  logo_corners: The four focuses of the reserve – geography, nature, the economy and society/culture – are represented by four arrows, which create an O for Ordino in the negative space. The chosen colours are warm and dynamic, more human, as human beings are at the centre of the exchanges and learning to enhance sustainable development.

  management: Management of the Biosphere Reserve
  responsible: The Comú (town council) of Ordino is the institution in charge of the reserve and is responsible for its management through the Coordination Committee of the Ordino Biosphere Reserve Management Plan.
  commission: The Coordination Committee is formed by the Governing Board, the Comú council and the heads of its departments which, in turn, establish sectoral working groups with local stakeholders.
  citizens: Every resident of the reserve can participate in any of the working groups or initiatives. The involvement of all stakeholders is key to the successful operation of the reserve.

      text:
        - The Sorteny Valley is a remarkable example of the many natural valleys in the parish of Ordino, which include Rialp and L’Angonella, and has been a protected area since 1999. The diverse habitats and well-preserved environment are behind the immense wealth of flora, with more than 800 species over an area of only 1,000 hectares (10 km2). Sorteny is especially notable for its rich, diverse marshes and peatbogs and is also a haven for rare and endangered flora, with 50 endemic Pyrenean species. For this reason, Sorteny Natural Park is a party to the Ramsar Convention and the Council of Europe’s Emerald Network for the protection of biodiversity.

      name: Our cultural heritage
      text:
        - Ordino’s cultural heritage is rich and diverse, tangible and intangible, the result of its people’s efforts and ingenuity to deal with social and economic challenges as they arise.
        - The particularities of the cultural landscapes within the reserve contribute to the local identity and reflect the history and interaction between communities and nature. The traditional mountain buildings - orris and pletes, cabanes and bordes, forges and mills, churches and chapels, and the festivals and traditions, are a living testimony of that interaction, the legacy of our ancestors.
